Project Gungnir - Impulse Defender for Megacities 

Project Objective: To develop a system of momentum accelerators that use projectiles without a low order explosive charge to propel at incoming enemies. This design prototype shall alleviate the heating, logistics, and cost-effective lethality per projectile for use in the cluttered, complicated, and confused battlefields in megacities tomorrow. 

Project Design

Shall be a culmination of off the shelf and novel components to achieve an alpha prototype ahead of commercialization. 

Project Timeline

Development based on critical path will be outlined in the design document.
